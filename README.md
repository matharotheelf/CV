## Thomas Lawrence

I am a creative and hardworking physics graduate from the University of Oxford. I am searching for a stimulating job in software development that will build my programming skills, so I can pursue an exciting career.

**Tech Skills** Python, Ruby, MatLab 

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

I am genuinely enthusiastic about thinking analytically. Throughout my physics degree I solved challenging problems, and tackled difficult topics, which both nurtured my analyticals skills and grew my interest in logical problems. It is these skills which I am excited to use in software development.

#### Creative Thinker

I am very interested in the arts as well as science. I constantly draw and go to life drawing classes every week. I won my college's art prize whilst at university. My creative thinking has also been fostered during my degree where I constantly needed creastive ideas to solve difficult problems. I anticipate using my creative side as much as my analytical side in my career as a software developer.

#### Team Worker

I greatly enjoy being part of a team as I am a naturally empathetic person. As part of my degree project I worked on evolutionary algorithms at the Diamond Light Source. It is here that I worked as part of a team of researchers to optimise the evolutionary algorithms' performance. Attending and contributing to group meetings was a highlight of my project. This project greatly improved my confidence in actively contributing to a group working in a technical area.

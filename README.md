  ## Thomas Lawrence

I am a creative and hardworking physics graduate of New College, University of Oxford who works as back-end developer. I am excited and confident of success in my future career.

**Tech Skills** Python, Ruby, JavaScript, React, Rails, SQL, AWS, Docker, Redux, Jenkins

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

I am genuinely enthusiastic about thinking analytically. Throughout my physics degree I solved challenging problems, and tackled difficult topics, which both nurtured my analyticals skills and grew my interest in logical problems. I believe robus processes are essential for successful software development. I have developed a robust debugging processes through extensive experience solving problems in my company's complex infastructure. I believe a logical process based approach is essential for the planning and realisation of any green field project, so targets can be met and imagination can be unleashed.

#### Creative Thinker

I am very interested in the arts as well as science. I constantly draw and go to life drawing classes every week. I won the New College art prize and was a finalist in the highly competitive London Drawing Group ‘Overdrawn’ Art Prize this year. My creative thinking has also been fostered in my degree where I constantly needed creative ideas to solve difficult problems. I anticipate using my creative side as much as my analytical side in my career as a software developer. I have combined my creative and technological skills to create a tool to create 360 art galleries instantly [Imaginespace](https://imaginespace.io). I am excited for future creative coding projects.

#### Team Worker

I greatly enjoy being part of a team as I am a naturally empathic person. As part of my degree project I worked on evolutionary algorithms at the Diamond Light Source. It is here that I worked as part of a team of researchers to optimise the evolutionary algorithms' performance. Attending and contributing to group meetings was a highlight of my project. This project greatly improved my confidence in actively contributing to a group working in a technical area. The highlight of my Makers'  experience was working on group projects where we used AGILE methodologies whilst solving complex coding problems.

I am an essential ingredient in my compainy's collaborative and open atmosphere. I have led stand ups, retros and sprint planning meetings. Collaboration is one of the most rewarding aspect of my software career, I always am open to help other developers and use pair programming often to share knowledge and overcome challenges. I founded an afterwork code club to share knowledge around the team, I have presented on a wide range of topics including: Rails' AREL API, concurrent programming and Rect 360.

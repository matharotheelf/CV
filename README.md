## Thomas Lawrence

I am a creative and hardworking physics graduate from the University of Oxford. I enjoy making art and I have an interest in visual culture. I am looking for a field of employment which will combine my creativity with my strong analytical skills. Therefore, I have a keen interest in software development and have greatly enjoyed past experiences in programming.

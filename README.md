  ## Thomas Lawrence

I am a physics graduate of New College, University of Oxford. I currently work as a mid-level software developer for a SaaS company, Homeflow. I have experience balancing personal projects with a busy professional life. 

**Tech Skills** Python, Ruby, JavaScript, React, Rails, SQL, AWS, Docker, Redux, Jenkins, Aframe

## Skills

#### Analytical Thinker

I developed my analytical skills throughout an intense degree syllabus, completing modules in advanced physics topics (Astrophysics, Theoretical Physics, Complexity, Advanced Physics Algorithms and Statistical Analysis for Experimental Physics). 

My current employer has a complex application network, with large legacy applications. Maintaining these sytems has developed a robust debugging process. I also enjoy innovating in green field projects, everything from building security for a database API, to my side projects creating software tools for creatives. I believe a robust process is essential for sucess in exciting projects.

#### Creative Thinker

As well as being interested in science, I am also interested in art. I combined my creative and technological skills to develop a tool to create 360 art galleries instantly [Imaginespace](https://imaginespace.io).

I attend life drawing classes weekly. I won the New College Art Prize and was a finalist in the highly competitive London Drawing Group ‘Overdrawn’ Art Prize in 2019.

#### Team Worker

I greatly enjoy working in teams. As part of my degree project I explored evolutionary algorithms at the Diamond Light Source. It is here that I collaborated as a team of researchers to optimise the evolutionary algorithms' performance. I contributed in brainstorming solutions to departmental meetings.

At Homeflow, I have led stand ups, retros and managed sprint cycles for the back-end team. In addition, I supervise and mentor junior developers entering the company. I write board reports and present on strategic projects. I collaborate with important clients, such as Connells the largest UK estate agency group and Rightmove, to overcome complex technical challenges.

I founded an afterwork code club to share knowledge around the team on a wide range of topics including: Rails' AREL API, concurrent programming and React 360.

#### Social Responsibility 

I regularly mentor in my local 'Codebar' where I teach minority groups how to code after we eat pizza!
